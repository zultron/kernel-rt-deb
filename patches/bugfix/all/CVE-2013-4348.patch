Subject: net: flow_dissector: fail on evil iph->ihl
Origin: https://git.kernel.org/linus/6f092343855a71e03b8d209815d8c45bf3a27fcd

We don't validate iph->ihl which may lead a dead loop if we meet a IPIP
skb whose iph->ihl is zero. Fix this by failing immediately when iph->ihl
is evil (less than 5).

This issue were introduced by commit ec5efe7946280d1e84603389a1030ccec0a767ae
(rps: support IPIP encapsulation).

[bwh: We have two versions of this code in wheezy due to backporting CoDel;
 the version in net/core/dev.c was patched in 3.2.54 and this covers the other]
