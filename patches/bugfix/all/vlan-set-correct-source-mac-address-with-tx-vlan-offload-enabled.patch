Subject: vlan: Set correct source MAC address with TX VLAN  offload enabled

With TX VLAN offload enabled the source MAC address for frames sent using the
VLAN interface is currently set to the address of the real interface. This is
wrong since the VLAN interface may be configured with a different address.

The bug was introduced in commit 2205369a314e12fcec4781cc73ac9c08fc2b47de
("vlan: Fix header ops passthru when doing TX VLAN offload.").

This patch sets the source address before calling the create function of the
real interface.
